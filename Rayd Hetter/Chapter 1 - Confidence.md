## The Interview

"Thank you for joining us... Mr. Hetter! We are glad to see you have made it to the interview stage, would you like to start by introducing yourself and stating a little bit about your passion projects?" The interviewer asked in a obviously fake-happy accent. 

The kind that really gets to you after a while. The tone so sweet it tastes bitter. It didn't bother me too much though, some how the light was even more distracting then her stupid voice. 



"Mr. Hetter..?" The interviewer pressing me for an answer.

"Ah, Yes. I apologize. I am, as you can imagine, nervous. Would you mind repeating the question to me dear?"

"Oh! Yeah of course. I was asking you for a short introduction and a little bit about some of the projects you where working on?"

"I see, thank you. Hmm..." I crossed my arms, staring off slightly.

"Well, to introduce myself, my name is Rayd Hetter. I am a graduate of two universities and the founder/CEO of a one, Confidence Institutes. As for more personal projects I have also started the online organization known as The Human Collective, focused on condensing the depth of human interests into a set of searchable data. We are completely funded on donations and we have partners like Google and Azure." I say methodically. 



"Thank you Mr. Hetter! Now I would love to talk to you about Confidence Ins." 

"Please do!"

"Well I was more so wondering, as the founder of a very famous company, and the head of a very powerful organization, why are you applying with us at Readem's?"

"Lucky me you asked. I was getting tired of all of it, I intend to step down or even away for a time being. I am a man who can never relax though. So I thought to apply to one of the companies that helped me get where I am today!"

"Ah I see!" She replied with that same stupid smile. 



## Skip the Dialogue



*The environment opens up to a noisy bar. The empty silence of the office worlds apart.*



"Okay, skip all the boring parts, tell me about the juicy bits!" said The Bartender.

"Fineee Clyde. You can't let a man enjoy his fun, can you?" Rayd spits back in a tone dripping with sarcasm.

"Ohh, old Mr. Hetter suddenly very sassy, hmm?" The Bartender bats back without hesitation. 

"Maybe I just hang around you too much, ever thought about that?" Rayd cuts in return

"Fair enough Rayd, got me there." The Bartender winks.

"I wish I came just for the sassy classes, but I'm plenty content learning about you." Rayd says, repositioning himself towards the Bartender. 

"Oh you!", The Bartender looks over, wide eyed, shocked at the way Rayd was speaking. "You never talk to me like that." he continues.

"I really should be more often." Rayd sighs. 
The Bartender blushes slightly before turning away from Hetter. 

"Oh shut-up!" he says playfully, "Please continue your story about this interview."



The world seems to spread out from Rayd's tumbler, the whiskey sloshing around with a consistency you'd expect from water, but the color you'd expect from sewage. All around the Bartender and Rayd where the clinking of glasses, high pitched, cutting to the ear. Wrapped in a blanket of warmth and soft speaking from patrons, Rayd felt most comfortable around here. He came here often.



Rayd's words fell with ease, his comfort growing with each drink.

"I told em!" - a small pause - "You know what I told em, Clyde?" Rayd said, pandering to try to hype up his small audience of one for cheer. 

"What did you say Rayd?" Clyde asked, rolling his eyes and smiling. 

"I said that I was there, applying to god forsaken Readem's, so I could rebuild the network from the inside, better then ever." Rayd said, spitting slight, letting his arms open wide, as if showing off the roof.

"Oh damn! Did you now?" Clyde answered back in unexpected surprise. 

"Yeah I did! And you know what's even better?" Rayd said, snapping his fingers. "They told me they would consider my interview and call me when they get details for my next interview." 

"What?" Clyde says back, nearly choking from shock. Eyes wider then golf balls. "You are kidding, right!?" he near shout screams

"No, no. I am being completely truthful, she took down my email and everything in case I couldn't pickup." Rayd said.

"... wha-" Clyde stumbling for words. "They are seriously considering hiring their competitor?" Clyde says softly, overcompensating for his earlier loudness, a tone of confusion littered through his response. 

Clyde leans onto the wooden counter, putting the glass to his left, face expressing a mix of blasphemy and stammered shock. Leaning towards Rayd, his palms supporting his face.

"They are doing to hire you?" Clyde says one more time, checking he wasn't just hearing things.

"That's my point!" Rayd says back, playing into Clyde's strong reaction. "That's my point!" Rayd chuckled. 

The expression on Clyde's face was a storm of confusion, shock, excitement and sheer bewilderment at the words Rayd was saying. Worst off, Clyde nearly felt like Rayd was nonchalant about it.

"This is insane, what now!? Is this even legal-" Clyde rattling off haphazardly, nearly knocking over a glass. Before Rayd can answer the increasingly angering pleads from patrons overwhelmed the pairs interest. 

Winking, Rayd said, "I'll tell you about it tomorrow!". A smirk grew on his attempted stoic face. "Hard not to smile when I look at you Clyde." he uttered out loud before turning around and walking towards the exit.

Cheers broke through the crowd of buzzed guests as drinks where back on the menu. Chatter now more overwhelming when there wasn't a conversation to distract you with. Rayd noticed it all.

Before he could leave, Rayd pulled a prewritten note and slide it onto the counter by the exit. A sudden overcoming of confidence filled his chest. He'd been waiting to place that note there for months, but between the interview and his recently perfect days, Rayd felt it appropriate to keep it going with more, hopefully, good news.
